# Obesidad: Factores Determinantes
This project is part of the requirements for completion of the DS Bootcamp from CoderHouse. 

## Context
Obesity and overweight are challenging health problems with potentially multifactorial causes. 
The main factors are believed to be a sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, and high-calorie diets, among others. 
There is also a suspicion of a predisposition due to family history of overweight. 
Identifying which factors have the greatest influence from an early age could improve the quality of life for the adult population.

## Objective:
To determine the factors that predispose individuals to obesity and overweight. 
For this purpose, a dataset titled "Obesity Based on Dietary Habits and Physical Conditions" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tathagatbanerjee/obesity-dataset-uci-ml) was used.
This dataset includes various parameters measured in a population from Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. The analysis focused on dietary habits, frequency of physical activity, 
family history of overweight, among other factors. Measurements were taken for both sexes across a broad age range (14-61 years).

## Dataset:
The dataset includes records of: weight, height, dietary habits, frequency of physical activity, family history of overweight, among others. 
Additionally, columns for BMI (Body Mass Index) and weight category were created (total columns: 17, rows: 2111).
