# Obesity: Determining Factors
This repository contains the final project for the Data Science Bootcamp at CoderHouse, focused on analyzing factors that determine obesity predisposition. The project spans six months and includes data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and results presentation.

## Context
Obesity and overweight are challenging health problems with potentially multifactorial causes. 
The main factors are believed to be a sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, and high-calorie diets, among others. 
There is also a suspicion of a predisposition due to family history of overweight. 
Identifying which factors have the greatest influence from an early age could improve the quality of life for the adult population.

## Objective:
To determine the factors that predispose individuals to obesity and overweight. 
For this purpose, a dataset titled "Obesity Based on Dietary Habits and Physical Conditions" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tathagatbanerjee/obesity-dataset-uci-ml) was used.
This dataset includes various parameters measured in a population from Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. The analysis focused on dietary habits, frequency of physical activity, 
family history of overweight, among other factors. Measurements were taken for both sexes across a broad age range (14-61 years).

## Dataset:
The dataset includes records of: weight, height, dietary habits, frequency of physical activity, family history of overweight, among others. 
Additionally, columns for BMI (Body Mass Index) and weight category were created (total columns: 17, rows: 2111).
